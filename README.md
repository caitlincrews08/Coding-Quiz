# Coding-Quiz

## Description

This website was developed as part of my week 4 homework assignment from the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Central Florida. The website consists of a timed multiple choice coding quiz that saves highscores in local storage.

The quiz begins when the user clicks "Start Quiz". A timer begins to count down from 70, allowing 10 seconds per question. If the user selects a wrong answer, 10 seconds gets deducted from the timer and the word "Wrong!" will display on the screen. If the user gets the question right, the word "Correct!" displays on the screen. The quiz ends when the timer runs out or the user answers all 7 questions. The final score is then displayed which is equal to the amount of time left on the timer. The user enters their initials and their score is added to their Highscores list.
